# Klebsiella pneumoniae  

## Introduction  

*Klebsiella pneumoniae* is a **Gram-negative**, non-motile, encapsulated, lactose-fermenting, and facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium. It can be found in a wide range of environments, including **soil, plants, water,** and **human bodies**, where it is part of the **normal flora** of mucosal membranes of the mouth, skin, and intestines.  

However, once it enters the **lungs** of humans or animals, it becomes **pathogenic**—highly **virulent** and **resistant to antibiotics**. It is the **most common cause** of hospital-acquired pneumonia and an important **nosocomial bacterial infection**.  

Additionally, it has been associated with patients with **alcohol use disorder** or **diabetes mellitus** and poses a **major threat** to **newborns, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals**.

## Genome Structure  

The *K. pneumoniae* genome consists of:  
- **One circular chromosome** (~5.5 Mbp, ~5,500 genes)  
- **Multiple plasmids**, including:  
  - *pPKPN1* (283,371 bp)  
  - *pPKPN2* (103,694 bp)  
  - *pPKPN3* (70,814 bp)  
  - *pPKPN4* (6,141 bp)  
  - Others  

### **Key Genomic Features**  
- Of the **5,500 genes**, about **3,500 are accessory genes**, including:  
  - **Acquired antimicrobial resistance genes**  
  - **Metal resistance genes**  
  - **Virulence genes**  

These characteristics contribute to the **highly dynamic and plastic nature** of *K. pneumoniae*.  

- **GC content**: ~57.5%  
- **Estimated number of Open Reading Frames (ORFs)**: ~5,000 (per NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation)  

### **Plasmids & Virulence**  
Plasmids include **virulence plasmids** that contain genes for:  
- **Hypervirulence factors** (e.g., *rmpA* - mucoid regulator)  
- **Aerobactin** & **salmochelin biosynthesis genes**  

Virulence factors—such as **fimbriae, capsules,** and **toxins**—are encoded in both the **genome** and **plasmids**, contributing to the bacterium’s **pathogenic potential**.

## Strains  

There are three **reported subspecies** of *K. pneumoniae*:  
1. *K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae*  
2. *K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae*  
3. *K. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis*  

However, this analysis focuses on **K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae**.  

### **Pathogenic Strains**  
Pathogenic *K. pneumoniae* strains can be broadly grouped into:  
- **Classical Klebsiella pneumoniae (cKP)**  
  - Generally **low virulence**  
  - Responsible for **nosocomial infections**  
- **Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP)**  
  - **Highly virulent**, capable of infecting **healthy individuals**  

### **Subtypes**  
These strains are further classified into:  
- **Sequence Types (STs)**: ST1, ST2, ..., ST14, ST15, etc.  
- **Capsular Serotypes (KLs)**: KL1, KL2, ..., KL100, KL102, KL103, etc.
